### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fast learner and quick problem solver working as Platform Engineer. Truly passionate about my work, I love hard challenges and I follow the KISS principle.

I'm pretty interested and involved in [Free and Open Source Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) development since ever: I contribute whenever possible to the projects I use and I've been member of the [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) [developers team](https://www.archlinux.org/people/developer-fellows/#andrea) for 7 years. I've also been a member of [KDE e.V.](https://ev.kde.org/members). Lastly, I do write applications for [SailfishOS](https://sailfishos.org/).
